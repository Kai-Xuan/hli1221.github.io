I am currently a first-year Ph.D student in [Jiangnan University](http://www.jiangnan.edu.cn/), supervised by **Pro. Xiao-Jun Wu**. 

I received my B.A. degree from School of Internet of Things Engineering at Jiangnan University, in 2015. Now I am working on Jiangsu Provincial Engineering Laboratory of Pattern Recognition and Computational Intelligence, Jiangnan University.
